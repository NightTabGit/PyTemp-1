What you do with this code / project / idea is non of my buisness or concern, and this was made for **educational** purposes only (testing software), and anything done with this code is NOT endorsed by me.

By using / utilizing PyTemp-1 you agree that you hold responsibility and accountability of any consequences caused by your actions.

# Explanation

The "loader.py" will create a file in /Temp (Something like this, "oaisduaiosdjw") and download the pre inserted download link into that file, execute it, and vwala, you got your beefy file running, but only from a much smaller file! <br>

A probably better alternative, to this beefy ass python version, is something akin to: 
- [x] https://github.com/UnamSanctam/UnamDownloader
- [x] https://github.com/UnamSanctam/UnamBinder

Since they both create **MUCH** smaller files then this one on compile. <br>
